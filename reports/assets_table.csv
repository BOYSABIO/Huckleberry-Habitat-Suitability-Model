Asset Key,Description,Simplified Description
qa,Surface Temperature Quality Assessment Band,"Let's break it down!

The ""Surface Temperature Quality Assessment Band"" is a way to measure and rate how well a surface (like a road or a building) is doing in terms of temperature.

Think of it like a report card for the surface. It's assessed based on its performance, and that performance is represented by a band (or range) of scores.

Here are some simple explanations:

* The ""Surface Temperature"" part refers to how hot or cold the surface is.
* ""Quality Assessment"" means that experts have evaluated this temperature data to give it a grade.
* A ""Band"" is like a range or a category that puts the surface's performance into one of several groups.

When someone says they're looking at the Surface Temperature Quality Assessment Band, they're likely trying to understand how well a surface is handling its temperature. Is it too hot? Too cold? Just right?

In simple terms, this asset helps us see how good or bad a surface is doing in terms of temperature, and that can be important for things like road maintenance, building design, or even just making sure people are comfortable!"
ang,Angle Coefficients File,"A nice and technical one!

In simple terms, an ""Angle Coefficients File"" is a data file that contains information about how different angles affect the behavior of something.

Imagine you're trying to predict how a car will perform on a curvy road. The file would contain special numbers (coefficients) that describe how the car's speed and direction change as it goes around bends of different angles. These coefficients help computers or engineers calculate the car's performance at various angles, which is useful for designing and optimizing things like racing tracks or vehicle dynamics.

In essence, the file provides a set of rules or formulas that link angle inputs to output values, making it easier to simulate or analyze complex systems that involve angles!"
red,Red Band,"A ""Red Band"" is a type of classification or rating for a movie, book, or other form of media. It's like a warning label that says, ""Hey, this content might not be suitable for everyone!""

In particular, a ""Red Band"" rating typically means the material contains strong language (bad words), explicit sexual content, and/or intense violence. Think R-rated movies or mature-themed books.

So, if something has a ""Red Band"" label, it's best suited for adults 18 years old or older who are comfortable with graphic content."
blue,Blue Band,"The ""Blue Band"" sounds like a brand name for something!

In simple terms, I'd say the ""Blue Band"" refers to a popular peanut butter brand that has a bright blue band or stripe on its jar. The peanut butter itself is likely creamy and delicious! Would you like me to explain more about what this asset might do or how it could be used?"
drad,Downwelled Radiance Band,"A technical term!

In simple terms, ""Downwelled Radiance Band"" refers to a specific range of wavelengths (or colors) that are emitted by the Earth's atmosphere.

Think of it like this: Imagine you're sitting outside on a sunny day. The sun's rays shine down on you and then bounce off the ground and surrounding objects, creating a warm glow. That's similar to what ""Downwelled Radiance"" is – the reflected light that comes back up from the Earth's surface.

The ""Band"" part refers to the specific range of wavelengths (or colors) within this reflected light. It's like a spectrum of colors, and in this case, it's focused on a particular set of frequencies that our instruments can detect.

So, when scientists talk about the Downwelled Radiance Band, they're referring to the unique patterns and characteristics of this specific range of reflected light, which can help us learn more about the Earth's atmosphere, climate, and even changes in weather patterns."
emis,Emissivity Band,"Let me break it down for you!

An ""Emissivity Band"" is a way to measure how much heat an object gives off (emits) at different wavelengths or colors of light.

Think of it like this:

* Imagine you're holding a warm cup of coffee. You can see the warmth radiating out as a glow, right?
* Now, imagine that glow is made up of tiny bits of energy, each with its own special wavelength or color (like red, orange, yellow, green, and so on).
* An emissivity band is like a filter that shows which of those wavelengths an object is giving off the most heat at. It helps us understand how well an object is radiating its internal temperature into the surrounding environment.

In simple terms, an emissivity band tells us what colors or wavelengths of light are being emitted by an object, and it's used in various fields like thermal imaging, astronomy, and even medical imaging!"
emsd,Emissivity Standard Deviation Band,"Let me break it down for you!

The ""Emissivity Standard Deviation Band"" is a way to measure how much heat (or energy) something gives off, like an object or a surface. Here's what each part of the phrase means:

* ""Emissivity"": This refers to how well an object gives off heat. Think of it like how good a friend is at sharing snacks - some objects are great at giving off their own heat (high emissivity), while others are not so good at it (low emissivity).
* ""Standard Deviation"" (SD): This is a statistical concept that shows how much variation there is from the average. In this case, it's like measuring how spread out the friends' snack-sharing habits are.
* ""Band"": This just means a range or an area. Imagine a band of colors - it's a specific section within a bigger spectrum.

So, when you put it all together, the ""Emissivity Standard Deviation Band"" is a way to measure the spread (or standard deviation) of how well an object gives off heat (its emissivity) over a certain range or area (the band). It helps scientists understand and compare the heat-emitting abilities of different materials or surfaces.

In simple terms, it's like measuring how good someone is at sharing snacks (emissivity), and then showing the spread of their snack-sharing habits (standard deviation) within a specific group or category (band)!"
trad,Thermal Radiance Band,"The ""Thermal Radiance Band"" is a type of sensor that measures the temperature of objects or people by detecting the heat they emit.

Think of it like a special kind of thermometer that can see from a distance. It works by picking up the infrared light, or ""heat signature"", given off by all objects with temperatures above absolute zero (that's really cold!).

This sensor is useful in many situations, such as:

* Monitoring body temperature for medical purposes
* Detecting heat leaks or insulation issues in buildings
* Tracking people or animals in environments where visibility is low

The ""Thermal Radiance Band"" helps us understand how hot or cold something is by converting its thermal radiation (heat) into a visual image."
urad,Upwelled Radiance Band,"Let me break it down for you!

The ""Upwelled Radiance Band"" is a type of light show that happens in the ocean. Here's what it means:

* ""Upwelled"" refers to water rising from the deep sea to the surface, carrying nutrients and sunlight with it.
* ""Radiance"" means the glowing or shining effect.

So, when we put it together, an Upwelled Radiance Band is a beautiful display of light that occurs when nutrient-rich water rises to the surface, causing the tiny plants (phytoplankton) and other organisms in the ocean to grow rapidly and emit a bright, shimmering glow. This phenomenon can be seen as a ""band"" or a strip of light stretching across the ocean's surface.

In simple terms, an Upwelled Radiance Band is like a natural light show that happens when the ocean comes alive with new life!"
atran,Atmospheric Transmittance Band,"Let me break it down for you!

An ""Atmospheric Transmittance Band"" refers to a specific range or window of light wavelengths that can pass through the Earth's atmosphere without being blocked or scattered. Think of it like a filter that lets certain colors of light shine through.

In simple terms, it means:

* ""Atmospheric"" refers to the air around us.
* ""Transmittance"" means the ability for light to pass through something (in this case, the atmosphere).
* ""Band"" refers to a specific range or group of wavelengths (or colors) that can get through.

So, an Atmospheric Transmittance Band is like a narrow corridor in the atmosphere where certain types of light can travel without being absorbed or scattered by particles in the air. This allows us to see those colors or wavelengths as they reach our eyes!"
cdist,Cloud Distance Band,"Let me break it down for you!

A ""Cloud Distance Band"" is a type of financial instrument that helps measure and manage risk in investments. Think of it like a safety net.

Here's what it does:

1. **Distance**: It sets a limit on how much an investment can fall (or ""distance"") before it gets triggered.
2. **Cloud**: This refers to the uncertainty or volatility surrounding an investment's value.
3. **Band**: This is the range or threshold where the instrument kicks in.

In simple terms, if an investment falls below the set distance (threshold), the Cloud Distance Band automatically buys or sells assets to minimize losses and maintain a stable portfolio. It helps investors protect their gains while still allowing them to benefit from potential market movements.

Does that make sense?"
green,Green Band,"A ""Green Band"" is a type of financial market indicator that shows how well or poorly a company's stock has been performing over time.

Think of it like a report card:

* A green band means the company's stock price has been rising, and its performance is good.
* It's like getting an ""A"" grade on your report card!

In simple terms, a Green Band is a positive sign that indicates the company's financial health is strong and investors are confident in its future."
nir08,Near Infrared Band 0.8,"Let me break it down for you!

The asset being described is a type of sensor that measures light with a specific wavelength, which is around 0.8 micrometers (μm). This wavelength falls into the near-infrared range.

Think of it like a camera lens: just as a camera can capture different wavelengths of visible light to produce different images, this sensor captures a specific part of the infrared spectrum, which is invisible to our eyes.

In simpler terms, this asset is a type of optical sensor that detects objects or surfaces by analyzing the way they reflect or absorb near-infrared light with a wavelength of about 0.8 μm."
lwir11,Surface Temperature Band,"A ""Surface Temperature Band"" is a way to categorize temperatures based on how hot or cold something is.

Think of it like a thermometer for the Earth's surface. It groups temperatures into different ranges, kind of like a bucket system:

* Low temperatures (e.g., -50°C to 0°C) = Cold
* Medium temperatures (e.g., 0°C to 25°C) = Moderate
* High temperatures (e.g., 25°C to 40°C) = Warm
* Extremely high temperatures (e.g., above 40°C) = Hot

This helps us understand and analyze temperature patterns on the Earth's surface, like how hot or cold a place is at different times of the year."
swir16,Short-wave Infrared Band 1.6,"Let me break it down for you!

The asset is a type of sensor data that measures light in the ""Short-wave Infrared"" part of the spectrum.

**What's the spectrum?**

Think of light like a big rainbow with different colors (like red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet). This light is made up of tiny particles called photons, which have different energies or wavelengths. The entire range of these photon energies/wavelengths is what we call the electromagnetic spectrum.

**What's Short-wave Infrared?**

In this part of the spectrum, the photons are a bit longer than the ones we can see with our eyes (like red light). These infrared photons have even more energy than visible light, but they're not as hot or intense as the ones in other parts of the infrared range.

**What's Band 1.6?**

Band 1.6 is like a specific filter that helps us focus on a particular range within this Short-wave Infrared part. It's like looking through a pair of sunglasses with a custom tint – it lets certain photons pass through while blocking others.

In simple terms, the asset measures light in the short-wave infrared band around 1.6 micrometers (μm) in wavelength. This data can be used for various applications, such as:

1. Thermal imaging: to detect heat signatures or temperature differences on objects or surfaces.
2. Vegetation health monitoring: to assess plant stress, growth, or water content based on the reflected infrared light.
3. Geological exploration: to identify mineral deposits, subsurface structures, or environmental changes.

These are just a few examples of how this asset can be used. The actual application depends on the specific use case and industry."
swir22,Short-wave Infrared Band 2.2,"Let me break it down for you!

The ""Short-wave Infrared Band"" part refers to a type of light or radiation that is invisible to our human eyes. It's like a special kind of light that exists at a specific range of wavelengths.

Think of it like a radio station: just as different frequencies (or channels) are used to transmit music, news, and other sounds, this ""band"" refers to a specific range of infrared light that is used for certain purposes.

The number ""2.2"" specifically indicates the wavelength or frequency of this short-wave infrared radiation. It's like a unique identifier or label that tells us where on the spectrum this type of light exists.

In simple terms, Short-wave Infrared Band 2.2 is a type of special light that has a specific wavelength and is used for certain applications, such as remote sensing, thermal imaging, or even medical imaging!"
coastal,Coastal/Aerosol Band,"The ""Coastal/Aerosol Band"" is a type of satellite image product.

Imagine you're taking a picture of the coastline from high above. You'd see the ocean, the land, and maybe some clouds or mist (like when you breathe onto a cold window). That's basically what this asset shows: a band around the Earth where the atmosphere meets the sea.

Here are some key things it can help you understand:

1. **Ocean currents**: By looking at how the water changes color near the coast, you can see where ocean currents are moving.
2. **Atmospheric pollution**: The misty stuff in the air (aerosols) can indicate pollutants like smoke or dust that might be coming from the land or sea.
3. **Weather patterns**: This image can help scientists study how weather systems develop near coastlines and how they interact with the ocean.

In simple terms, the ""Coastal/Aerosol Band"" is a helpful tool for understanding the connection between the ocean and the atmosphere, which is important for predicting weather and tracking environmental changes."
mtl.txt,Product Metadata File (txt),"A Product Metadata File is a text file that contains important information about products, such as:

* What the product does
* Its size and shape
* The materials it's made of
* Any instructions or warnings for using it
* Other details that might be helpful to know

Think of it like a label on a product box. It gives you all the key facts about what you're buying, so you can make informed decisions.

In this file, the information is written in plain text (not in code) and can be easily read by humans or computers. This makes it easy to share and use for things like creating lists of products, looking up product details, or even automating tasks related to those products."
mtl.xml,Product Metadata File (xml),"Let me break it down for you!

**Asset:** Product Metadata File (XML)

**Simple Explanation:** An XML file is like a digital folder where we store information about products, such as:

* What's inside the product
* How to use it
* Any specific instructions or warnings
* And other details that help us understand what the product is and how it works

Think of it like a digital label on a product. Just like how you might read the instructions on a toy box to know how to play with it, this XML file helps us understand more about each product by providing its ""metadata"" (or information) in a organized way.

**Key Points:**

* It's a type of file that stores information (data)
* The data is formatted using a special language called XML
* The file contains details about products, making it useful for many purposes like inventory management or customer support"
mtl.json,Product Metadata File (json),"In simple terms, a ""Product Metadata File (json)"" is like a digital label that provides extra information about a product.

Think of it like a tag on a shirt that has details such as the brand name, size, color, and price. This file stores similar kinds of details in a special format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

It's used to keep track of products' characteristics, specifications, and other important facts. When someone wants to learn more about a product, they can easily access this file to get the necessary information.

For example, if you're an online shopper looking at a new pair of shoes, the product metadata file might contain details like:

* Brand name
* Style number
* Color options
* Sizes available
* Price
* Material used (like leather or synthetic)
* Weight

Having this information readily available makes it easier for customers to make informed purchasing decisions and helps businesses manage their products more efficiently."
qa_pixel,Pixel Quality Assessment Band,"The ""Pixel Quality Assessment Band"" is a way to measure how good or bad the quality of pixels (tiny squares of color) are on a screen, like your phone or computer.

Think of it like a report card for pixels. It gives them a grade from A to F based on things like:

* How clear and sharp they are
* If there's any blurriness or fuzziness
* If the colors look good and accurate

The band helps you understand how well your device is displaying pictures, text, and other digital content. This is important because it can affect how easy it is to read and see things on your screen.

For example, if a pixel quality assessment says an image looks good (like an A or B grade), that means the picture should look clear and sharp when you view it on your device. But if it says the image looks bad (like a C or F grade), that might mean the picture is blurry or hard to see.

So, the Pixel Quality Assessment Band helps you figure out how well your device is handling digital content, which can be important for things like gaming, watching videos, or even just browsing the internet."
qa_radsat,Radiometric Saturation and Terrain Occlusion Quality Assessment Band,"Let me break it down for you!

**Radiometric Saturation**: This is a measure of how well the sensor or camera captures the brightness (or intensity) of the light coming from the Earth's surface. Think of it like a photo: if an image is ""saturated,"" it means the bright areas are overexposed and may lose detail. In this context, radiometric saturation refers to whether the sensor can accurately capture the range of brightness values in the scene.

**Terrain Occlusion Quality Assessment**: This part checks how well the data reflects what's happening on the ground. ""Occlusion"" refers to when something blocks our view (like a hill or a building). The quality assessment evaluates how effectively the data reveals these blockages and what's underneath them.

**Band**: In remote sensing, a ""band"" usually refers to a specific wavelength of light that the sensor can capture. Think of it like different color channels in an image. Each band might highlight unique features or properties of the scene, such as vegetation health, water levels, or soil moisture.

So, when you put it all together: The Radiometric Saturation and Terrain Occlusion Quality Assessment Band is a tool that analyzes how well the sensor captures brightness values (radiometric saturation) while also evaluating how effectively it shows what's happening on the ground (terrain occlusion), across specific wavelengths of light (bands)."
qa_aerosol,Aerosol Quality Assessment Band,"Let me break it down for you!

An ""Aerosol Quality Assessment Band"" is a tool used to measure and evaluate the quality of tiny particles suspended in the air, called aerosols. Think of it like a report card for the air we breathe.

Here's how it works:

1. The band has different color zones or sections.
2. Each section represents a specific level of aerosol quality (e.g., very clean, somewhat polluted, heavily polluted).
3. When an aerosol sample is taken and analyzed, the results are compared to the color zones on the band.
4. The corresponding color zone tells us how good or bad the air quality is.

In simple terms, the Aerosol Quality Assessment Band helps us quickly identify whether the air we're breathing is clean, moderate, or hazardous. This information can be used by scientists, policymakers, and the public to make informed decisions about environmental health, air pollution control measures, and more!"
tilejson,TileJSON with default rendering,"TileJSON is a type of digital map data that provides information about tiles (small sections) of a map. It's like a map legend, but instead of showing what different colors or symbols mean, it tells computers how to put together these small tile pieces to form a complete map.

Think of it like a recipe for making a digital cake. The recipe (TileJSON) lists the ingredients (tile images), their sizes, and how they fit together (like layers of a cake). This way, when someone wants to display the map on their computer or phone, they can follow the recipe and assemble the tiles correctly.

In simple terms, TileJSON is like a blueprint for building digital maps. It helps computers understand what each tile looks like, where it belongs, and how to arrange them to show you a complete and accurate map!"
rendered_preview,Rendered preview,"The ""Rendered Preview"" asset is a digital image that shows what something will look like before it's actually created.

Think of it like a virtual prototype or a test run. It gives you an idea of how something will turn out, so you can make changes or improvements before putting in the actual work.

For example, if someone is designing a website, they might create a rendered preview to show what the site will look like with certain colors, fonts, and layouts. This helps them decide whether to keep or change those elements before building the actual website."
