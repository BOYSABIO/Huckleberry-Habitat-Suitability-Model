## Group Meeting 1

> Balance product risk with tech risk.  
  
Recommended: Start with a batch of ideas, narrow them down into projects worth expanding on, build on those projects further and then choose. Do not limit yourself.  
  
```
Deadlines:
1) Ideation: NOW
2) 
```
Pay attention to lisence model when adding new data to the model or dataset. If you have to pay huge amounts, it will change the final output in terms of cost/pricing.  
  
> Notes:

- Deadline: ideation (next meetings)
- ROI: 4-10 years forecast estimation, based on hypothesis
- Explore all sectors to start and then narrow down (no need to end with just one sector though)
- Technological risk + Customers commitment 
- Sources/things to support our idea: market size, similar solutions, convincing people to give us money.
- Dataset: we can use additional datasets (has to be of free access for comercialitazion - this info should be stated on the website, if itâ€™s not, email them).
- Legalization regarding data: gemini/chatgpt
- Target B2B preferible (easier), but anything would work
- Take into account costs to select the solution we are providing (more complex is not always better)
